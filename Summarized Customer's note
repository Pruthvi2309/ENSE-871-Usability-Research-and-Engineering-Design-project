Feedback on our team – Group C
•	From Professor - Need to add membership option in our 1st release of MVP.
•	From Customer- Need to remove the registration for workshop under Event browsing option (upcoming and current) as they have only one yearly workshop.

Our Overall understanding based on customer feedback to each team.
•	Having comment function on the shared content is ok like/follow or any reaction function is not required.
•	It is SIG networking site not self promotion site.
•	SIG website will be a standalone site.
•	DM function is nice to have otherwise email function is ok.
•	Payment feature is not required.
•	Two official languages English and French is ok. No more languages require.
•	Accessibility is a nice to have function.
